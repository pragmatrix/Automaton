An F# port of 

[Automatom:](https://github.com/evancz/automaton)

a library for structuring reactive code based on the [Arrowized FRP](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/workshop-02.pdf).

This F# port is experimental. Hostile behavior, bad performance, space and time leaks are to be expected. 

My primary intention for the port is to experiment with pure functional concepts that support the composition of stateful components.
